3.0.2

Bug Fixes:
* Removed Courier, Siege Engineer, Worker, and Bard from Ancient Warfare JEI blacklist (#45)
* Disabled the spread of Pam's Harvestcraft Gardens (#35)
* The Mob Spawner item is now visible in JEI
* Fixed (hopefully) Main Menu graphics not working on Linux (#36)

Enhancements:
* Lowered Ancient Warfare Structure spawns from 7% to 5%
* Lowered Apotheosis potential spawner upgrades to help limit how powerful players can make their mob farms. This should help alleviate some performance issues on servers and single player
* CalmDownZombieGuy has been set to limit Rats mod AI in hopes of alleviating performance issues (there will still be some lag read further below for more info)
* Removed extra BG.png file in pack export
* Cut in half the total amount of Silverfish veins in the Beneath and lowered the max size of veins

Mod Updates:
* Calm Down Zombie Guy (1.3.1 - 1.4.0)
* Stacking Dimensional Rifts (1.12.2-1.1.0 - 1.12.2-1.1.1)
* Apotheosis (1.12.2-1.11.6 - 1.12.2-1.11.8) - Increased the quality of gear drops from Apotheosis (#46)
* Betweenlands (3.5.1 - 3.5.2) - Fixed an issue causing Forestry and other mod's recipes to not show up (#30)

Known Issues:
* The Rats mod causes lag when set to automate tasks. We are exploring ways on how to help alleviate this issue without removing the entire mod at this time

3.0.1

Bug Fixes:
* Disabled Silent's Gear nerf of Vanilla Equipment except for Wood and Stone
* Enabled JEI to show Botania Mana Tablet
* Hid Morbs from Galacticraft not being hidden (#26)
* Disabled the logging of Cascading Worldgen Lag. We are aware of the logs and no longer require tickets at this time (#23)
* Turned down addiction level of Crackpack by 20%
* Removed Resource Pack accidentally shipping with the modpack
* Fixed a recipe conflict with the Block Craftery Framed Block (#31)
* Re-enabled the Forestry work table to help with any recipe conflicts

Mod Updates:
* Stacking Dimensional Rifts  (1.12.2-1.0.0 - 1.12.2-1.1.0)
* EIOP (1.12.2-1.0.0 - 1.12.2-1.0.1)
* Forestry (1.12.2-5.8.2.408 - 1.12.2-5.8.2.409)

Known Issues:
* We are aware of an issue stopping Forestry machine recipes from showing up and working on trying to fix it. The recipes do work, they currently do not show in JEI and it seems to be a modpack specific issue
